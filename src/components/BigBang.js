            <div className="title">Basic Concept</div>
            <div className="content">The Big Bang theory proposes that the universe began from an extremely small, hot, and dense singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. From this singularity, the universe underwent a process of expansion and gradual cooling.</div>
            <div className="title">The Process</div>
            <div className="content">Planck Era: This was the earliest moment after the Big Bang, where current physical laws are insufficient to accurately describe the phenomena. Inflation Era: The universe underwent a very rapid and sudden expansion, smoothing out initial irregularities in its structure. Quark and Lepton Formation: Fundamental particles like quarks and leptons began to form from the extremely high energy of the universe. Proton and Neutron Formation: Quarks combined to form protons and neutrons, the nuclei of atoms. The Era of First Light (around 380,000 years after the Big Bang): Atoms began to form as electrons combined with nuclei, allowing photons to move freely and illuminate the universe.</div>
            <div className="title">Supporting Evidence</div>
            <div className="content">Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB): This is the residual radiation from the time when the universe became transparent, first discovered in 1965, and is considered strong evidence supporting the Big Bang theory. Expansion of the Universe: Edwin Hubble's 1929 study showed that galaxies are moving away from each other, consistent with the Big Bang theory's prediction of an expanding universe. Light Element Composition: The distribution and ratios of elements like hydrogen and helium in the universe align with predictions from the Big Bang model.</div>
            <div className="title">Continuous Expansion</div>
            <div className="content">The universe is still expanding, and scientists use modern technologies such as telescopes and satellites to study its development over time. Some modern research focuses on gaining a better understanding of dark energy and dark matter, two mysterious components in the current cosmological model. The Big Bang theory not only provides a perspective on the origin of the universe but also opens up new research directions, helping us gain deeper insights into the structure and evolution of the cosmos.</div>
