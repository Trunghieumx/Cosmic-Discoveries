Constellations are not groups of stars physically related to each other in space, but are symbolic arrangements created by humans since ancient times.
Ancient people observed the night sky to navigate, predict seasons, and create stories related to the star groups they saw. For example:
The constellation Orion is associated with hunters in Greek mythology.
The constellation Ursa Major (Great Bear) is popular in many cultures.</div>
