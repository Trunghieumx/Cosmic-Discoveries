            <div className="title">Formation from Gas and Dust Clouds (Around 4.6 Billion Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">Earth and other planets in the Solar System were formed from a massive cloud of gas and dust. This cloud, called the protoplanetary disk, contracted under the influence of gravity, forming the Sun at its center. The remaining dust and gas gradually clumped together, forming planetesimals and eventually the planets.</div>
            <div className="title">Heating and Differentiation (Around 4.5 Billion Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">During this stage, Earth experienced intense heating due to collisions with other celestial bodies and the radioactive decay of elements. This led to the differentiation of Earth: a molten iron-nickel core formed at the center, surrounded by the mantle, and covered by a solid outer crust.</div>
            <div className="title">Formation of the Moon (Around 4.5 Billion Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">A major event occurred when a Mars-sized celestial body collided with Earth. This impact ejected a large amount of material into space, which eventually coalesced to form the Moon over time.</div>
            <div className="title">Cooling and Formation of the Crust (Around 4 Billion Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">Earth gradually cooled, and the solid outer crust began to form. Simultaneously, oceans started to appear as water vapor condensed.</div>
            <div className="title">The Beginning of Life (Around 3.5 Billion Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">Favorable conditions in the primordial oceans allowed life to emerge. Single-celled organisms, such as cyanobacteria, began photosynthesis, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.</div>
            <div className="title">Accumulation of Oxygen in the Atmosphere (Around 2.5 Billion Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">The process of photosynthesis continued for billions of years, leading to an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This created conditions favorable for the evolution of more complex life forms.</div>
            <div className="title">Development of Mammals and Humans</div>
            <div className="content">After the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals began to develop and diversify. Around 200,000 years ago, modern humans (Homo sapiens) appeared and began to evolve.</div>
            <div className="title">The Modern Era</div>
            <div className="content">Over the past few thousand years, humans have developed civilizations and technologies, significantly impacting Earth's environment and climate.</div>
            <div className="title">Development of Continents and Supercontinents</div>
            <div className="content">Over hundreds of millions of years, Earth's tectonic plates moved, collided, and separated, forming continents. During this process, supercontinents such as Pangaea formed and eventually broke apart.</div>
            <div className="title">The Age of Dinosaurs (Around 250-65 Million Years Ago)</div>
            <div className="content">During the Mesozoic Era, dinosaurs and many other giant creatures dominated Earth. This era ended with a mass extinction event, likely caused by the impact of a massive asteroid or intense volcanic activity.</div>
